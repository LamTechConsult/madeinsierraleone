##### What is this? #####
This is a "creative branding" project titled "Made in Sierra Leone" that was initiated and sponsored by LAM-TECH Consulting https://lamtech.sl based in Freetown, Sierra Leone on behalf of the people of Sierra Leone.
This IS NOT A Government of Sierra Leone Initiated or sponsored project. No funding was received from any outside donor, company, government or individual.

##### Project Background Information #####
The primary objective of the project is to create "digital branding assets" to be used by anyone willing and ready to promote "Made in Sierra Leone" products and services.
We decided to create these assets because we have seen a push by the people of Sierra Leone to promote "Made in Sierra Leone" products and services. This push is currently not unified from a messaging point of view.
As a Digital company based in Sierra Leone and creating Software products and services in Sierra Leone, we needed a professional brand image to promote the initiative and believed others in our industry and other industries need the same.

As soon as we started the process and made initial designs public to get feedback, we were informed that the Sierra Leone Opportunities for Business Action (SOBA) collaborated with the Ministry of Trade & Industry, Finance, Agriculture, Tourism, Foreign Affairs, Fisheries and related agencies to run a logo competition involving designers and marketing companies.
A committee of design professionals with input from government judged the entries and picked a winner. About a year ago, SOBA awarded the winner and handed over the logo to Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI). Due to project continuity problems we typically have in Sierra Leone, it seems this one is dead or waiting to be activated again.

To continue promoting made in Sierra Leone products and services, without waiting for the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) to take action, LAM-TECH Consulting https://lamtech.sl created a couple of brand images and asked the public for feedback.
We believe that professional created brand assets will help Sierra Leone consistently send the same message of "Made in Sierra Leone" across.

While we wait for the official government ministry to take action, we encourage all individuals and companies creating products and services out of Sierra Leone to use the selected logo above to send a unified "Made in Sierra Leone" Message online and in print.
This will help us all send one message when it comes to all things “made in Sierra Leone”

##### How to use it? #####
You are free to use the https://github.com/LamTechConsult/madeinsierraleone/blob/master/Final-selected-logo/made-in-sl-logo3.png selected logo to promote "Made in Sierra Leone" Products and Services on your website, social media and print media. If any of the other logos make sense to you and you want to use them to create a unique brand for your product, service or company, feel free to use them. All we ask for is proper copyright credit for the creative work.

##### Details of the final logo - made-in-sl-logo3.png #####
Spread of "wings" and posture of carrying something will make it stand out.  Also will be great to animate wings for demo reel
Wings with guy is very interesting and has a lot of elements related to better standards, market viability, above expectations etc

##### About the various logos #####
When we were researching the branding of this logo design, we found out some must have criterias;
- brand-able
- can be broken into simple iconic elements
- memorable and unique but not intrusive or bias
- commercially viable, politically neutral
- encompasses all the elements of things made in a country
- global reach

The following designs are the ones that met all those criteria and involves certain personal ones we aimed for this project
- keep it simple and recognizable
- represents: achievement, earth, above expectations, market viability, rising and expanding standards, labor and products ambiguity, inclusive of all nature of business.

In order of best to least from the images in the <a href="#">initial-designs folder</a>

Best branding elements including global reach, unique, etc
#2, #12, #11, #6, #16

Best for 3D version: such as embossing, easy to reproduce, animation, etc
#11, #6, #16, #12, #2,

Best for animation: such as wow factor, commercial TV ready, secondary uses
#6  - spread of "wings" and posture of carrying something will make it stand out (a la the peacock spread of the MSNBC, etc).  Also will be great to animate wings for demo reel
#11 - the circles will animated as spinning and will make it also very interesting and unique.
#2 - arms can move and animate into different movements if you wish.  Very good for a short narrative when introducing a anything as well as for advertisement
#12- spinning circles are simple but works very well for getting attention as well as for gifs, social branding etc.  especially beside a static text
#16 - not much animation but can get the trees to wave and the sun to move.  Good for commercials and short intros.  Not very unique

Our choice(s) are:
#6 - wings with guy is very interesting and has a lot of elements related to better standards, market viability, above expectations etc
#2 - unique but general and culturally viable.  shows abstract workers/citizens
#12 - very easy to brand and can be pushed to be very recognizable.  It is a abstract take on sierra leone values
#16 - too general and a bit on the "islands" kind of take.  But it might be the simplest and the most recognizable if utilized well.  The only issue is that its mostly text and cant be separated well from its elements

We did not choose Sierra Leonean map as it gets lost in smaller sizes and does not work well for legibility in most circumstances
The colors will get blurred too easily and just like its last counter part, the Sierra Leonean map in perspective that get confused when viewed quickly - its too uniform and wont work.
