Quick feedback needed. Does any of the sketches represent what you will to see as a brand image for "Made in Sierra Leone" products and services? Background: I am trying to create a professional and unified "Made in Sierra Leone" brand asset for digital and print media that can be used by anyone creating products and services in Sierra Leone. A way to consistently send the same message across but in style. If none of these make sense, please feel free to say so.


If you were asked which one of these logos or brand images you will prefer to to use for as the “made in Sierra Leone” brand image or logo. Which one will you soon? There are two versions of each. White background and black background. Each logo have is numbered.

To promote made in Sierra Leone products and services, we are trying to create a unified brand image that can be used digitally and in print to mark products and services as made in Sierra Leone. This is not a government project at this time but we are hoping that the government will see this and recognize that there is a need for such branding and take action. They may choose to use the logo we end up with or create another. While we wait for that, we will encourage all individuals and companies creating products and services out of Sierra Leone to use the logo we will end up selecting. This will help us all send one unified message when it comes to all things “made in Sierra Leone”

Tamba, just so you know, as part of a project for which I was team leader last year (called Sierra Leone Opportunities for Business Action or SOBA), we collaborated with the Ministry of Trade & Industry, Finance, Agriculture, Tourism, Foreign Affairs, Fisheries and related agencies to run a logo competition involving designers and marketing companies. A committee of design professionals with input from government judged the entries and picked a winner. About a year ago, we awarded the winner and handed over the logo to MTI. I hope they’re going to use it with the new Made in Sierra Leone (MiSL) push, which SOBA supported.

I’m just sharing because in Sierra Leone continuity can be a problem, but I’m in contact with many of these officials to ensure they are aware of assets created that remain at their disposal.

When I was researching the branding of this logo design, I found out some must have criterias like 
- brand-able
- can be broken into simple iconic elements
- memorable and unique but not intrusive or bias
- commercially viable, politically neutral
- encompasses all the elements of things made in a country
- global reach

The following designs are the ones I think met all those criteria and involves certain personal ones i aimed for this project
- keep it simple and recognizable
- represents: achievement, earth, above expectations, market viability, rising and expanding standards, labor and products ambiguity, inclusive of all nature of business.

In order of best to least

Best branding elements including global reach, unique, etc
#2, #12, #11, #6, #16

Best for 3D version: such as embossing, easy to reproduce, animation, etc
#11, #6, #16, #12, #2,

Best for animation: such as wow factor, commercial TV ready, secondary uses
#6  - spread of "wings" and posture of carrying something will make it stand out (a la the peacock spread of the MSNBC, etc).  Also will be great to animate wings for demo reel
#11 - the circles will animated as spinning and will make it also very interesting and unique.
#2 - arms can move and animate into different movements if you wish.  Very good for a short narrative when introducing a anything as well as for advertisement
#12- spinning circles are simple but works very well for getting attention as well as for gifs, social branding etc.  especially beside a static text
#16 - not much animation but can get the trees to wave and the sun to move.  Good for commercials and short intros.  Not very unique

My choice(s) would be:
#2 - unique but general and culturally viable.  shows abstract workers/citizens
#6 - wings with guy is very interesting and has a lot of elements related to better standards, market viability, above expectations etc
#12 - very easy to brand and can be pushed to be very recognizable.  It is a abstract take on sierra leone values
#16 - too general and a bit on the "islands" kind of take.  But it might be the simplest and the most recognizable if utilized well.  The only issue is that its mostly text and cant be separated well from its elements


I didnt choose sierra leonean map as it gets lost in smaller sizes and doesnt work well for legibility in most circumstances,  The colors will get blurred too easily and just like its last counter part, the sierra leonean map in perspective that get confused when viewed quickly - its too uniform and wont work.
